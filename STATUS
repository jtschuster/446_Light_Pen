Currently, I have explored writing to the framebuffer linux device to change the contents of the screen. Doing this pixel by pixel goes slower than desired, so I plan to remedy this as best as possible by using double buffering.
Instead of completely overwriting the screen with different light levels, I plan to change the brightness of sections of the screen only slightly from their original state and use the difference in brightness to determine where the photoresistor is placed on the screen. With tuning, hopefully the location can be determined with minimal interference to the screen.
I tried using a six channel photo sensor that uses I2C, but I2C seems too slow for this, so a simple photoresistor has been ordered and I will test that with direct ADC in the coming week. 
This week I plan to test changing the light levels and determine the minimum changes in RGB brightness to accurately notice a change on the screen. Using that information I hope to write an algorithm to efficiently determine the location of the sensor on the screen without affecting the users view of the screen too much.

TODO:
	Min change in brightness (at different RGB levels)
	Algorithm for changing screen 
		Should I change light levels of large sections at a time and get smaller, or begin changing smaller sections?
		Do I need to account for if the pen is on the edge of the different sections?
		How can I best eliminate the effect of ambient light? Is covering the sensor enough, or do I need to make software accomodations for it?

Currently, I have code to change the brightness of the screen using a double buffer, which speeds up the time immensely. The program currently determines the average brightness of 5 x 5 boxes on the screen and will increase or decrease the RGB values of the pixels depending on if the box is above or below half maximum brightness. I also have a photo cell to determine the brightness levels of the screen. However, ambient light is much brighter than the rest of the screen, so the sensor must be closed off the the ambient light. I plan to place a stylus head with a hole in it on top of the photo cell as a makeshift cover to test how it works. The differences in brightness will also be very low, so I plan to use amplifying or differentiating op amps or some combination of both to make reading light levels of the screen more accurate and precise.
This week I will continue to test different methods of filtering and amplifying the signal from the photo cell to determine what change in light levels I need and what combination of op amps works best. Once that is tested, I will also begin testing placing a cursor using this.

TODO:
	Test different screen light levels with:
		op amp alone
		differentiating op amp alone
		differentiating op amp with op amp
