Currently, I have explored writing to the framebuffer linux device to change the contents of the screen. Doing this pixel by pixel goes slower than desired, so I plan to remedy this as best as possible by using double buffering.
Instead of completely overwriting the screen with different light levels, I plan to change the brightness of sections of the screen only slightly from their original state and use the difference in brightness to determine where the photoresistor is placed on the screen. With tuning, hopefully the location can be determined with minimal interference to the screen.
I tried using a six channel photo sensor that uses I2C, but I2C seems too slow for this, so a simple photoresistor has been ordered and I will test that with direct ADC in the coming week. 
This week I plan to test changing the light levels and determine the minimum changes in RGB brightness to accurately notice a change on the screen. Using that information I hope to write an algorithm to efficiently determine the location of the sensor on the screen without affecting the users view of the screen too much.

TODO:
	Min change in brightness (at different RGB levels)
	Algorithm for changing screen 
		Should I change light levels of large sections at a time and get smaller, or begin changing smaller sections?
		Do I need to account for if the pen is on the edge of the different sections?
		How can I best eliminate the effect of ambient light? Is covering the sensor enough, or do I need to make software accomodations for it?

getting power from the power from the msp430 is too noisy for the supply unless I maybe low pass filter the power supply.
low pass filtering seems to work okay for filtering the signal back, but using a capacitor straight to ground is probably better. 


Optimized array access to be sequential. Can detect differences in low-levels, but not in high levels. 


I now have the photo cell signal going through an MSP430 microcontroller which does an ADC conversion and tracks two time buffered exponential moving averages of the signal. If the signal changes, the MSP430 will send a signal to the Raspberry Pi that runs the screen.
The Pi changes the brightness of half of the screen and leaves the other half, then changes every fourth of the screen, then every eighth and so on. An interrupt handler marks during which screen a signal is sent, and that information is used to determine which half, fourth, eighth, etc, the sensor is located within the screen. 
It can track the location of the sensor up to within about 20 pixels most of the time. However, this takes about 11 frames, and as the sizes of the parts of the screen that change get smaller, the cell is more likely to be on a border between pixels that change and pixels that don't, and accuracy goes down. 
This week I plan to look into how the signal changes when the sensor is over a border and try to find a way to deal with when that happens or try to avoid it. I also plan to speed up the rendering by threading the back buffer rendering and looking to find where else I can make it more efficient.
